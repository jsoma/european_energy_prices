# European energy prices

This repository contains the code to an automated daily scraper of the energy prices in most European countries, and data on the hourly energy prices and daily average prices since December 1st, 2022. 

The file `index.html` contains the code for the website https://laurabejder.github.io/european_energy_prices/ which displays autoupdating charts of the daily and hourly energy prices of tomorrow. 

### Notebooks
- `1_energy_prices_scrape.ipynb`: Using (mostly) playwright, this notebook scrapes the day-ahead energy prices from the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity's (ENTSO-E) [website](https://transparency.entsoe.eu/transmission-domain/r2/dayAheadPrices/show?name=&defaultValue=false&viewType=GRAPH&areaType=BZN&atch=false&dateTime.dateTime=06.01.2023+00:00|CET|DAY&biddingZone.values=CTY|10YSE-1--------K!BZN|10Y1001A1001A47J&resolution.values=PT15M&resolution.values=PT30M&resolution.values=PT60M&dateTime.timezone=CET_CEST&dateTime.timezone_input=CET+(UTC+1)+/+CEST+(UTC+2)). ENTSO-E is the association for the cooperation of the European transmission system operators (TSOs), and thus has data on most European countries. 
- `2_several_days.ipynb`: This notebook cleans up today's data scrape and appends it to `europaenergy.csv` â€“ a csv containing the hourly prices for all countries since January 2nd, 2023.
